    <h2>Performance First Approach</h2>
    
    <p>Performance should be a primary consideration from the very beginning of your project. Modern users expect fast, responsive applications, and search engines favor performant websites.</p>
    
    <p>Key performance optimization strategies include:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Implementing lazy loading for images and components</li>
        <li>Using efficient bundling and code splitting techniques</li>
        <li>Optimizing asset delivery with CDNs</li>
        <li>Minimizing JavaScript bundle sizes</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Accessibility and Inclusive Design</h2>
    
    <p>Building accessible web applications isn't just about compliance—it's about creating inclusive experiences for all users. Modern web development should prioritize accessibility from the design phase through implementation.</p>

    <p>Essential accessibility practices include using semantic HTML, providing proper alt text for images, ensuring adequate color contrast, and implementing keyboard navigation support.</p>

    <h2>Modern JavaScript and Framework Adoption</h2>
    
    <p>The JavaScript ecosystem continues to evolve rapidly. Staying current with modern JavaScript features and popular frameworks can significantly improve your development experience and application quality.</p>
    
    <p>Consider adopting ES6+ features, exploring modern frameworks like React, Vue, or Svelte, and implementing proper state management solutions for complex applications.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    
    <p>Modern web development is about balancing performance, accessibility, maintainability, and user experience. By following these best practices and staying curious about emerging technologies, you can build applications that not only meet current standards but are also prepared for future challenges.</p>
    
    <p>Remember, the best practice is often the one that fits your specific project needs and team capabilities. Stay flexible, keep learning, and don't be afraid to experiment with new approaches.</p>
